##Descripton:
Hello stranger reading this description, my name is Adam Espinoza and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I am applying to CODE2040 because I want to explore the diversity of the tech industry and meet other like minded Latinx and people of color in STEM. 

I do not necessarily have a lot of background working with JSON and Python since my primary languages are C++ and Java, so please forgive me for any awkward syntax! This project, however, was incredibly fun to undertake in my free time. I definitely learned a lot about working with APIs, HTTPs, and markdown.  

##Refrences:
Here are a list of refrences I utilized to make this project come together:
