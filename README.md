# CODE2040 Project

-**Name:** Adam Espinoza

-**School:** University of Southern California

-**Major:** Computer Science and Business Administration

-**Minor:** Applied Computer Security

##Descripton:
Hello stranger reading this description, my name is Adam Espinoza and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I am applying to CODE2040 because I want to explore the diversity of the tech industry and meet other like-minded Latinx and people of color in STEM. 

I do not necessarily have a lot of background working with JSON and Python since my primary languages are C++ and Java, so please forgive me for any awkward syntax. A lot of my time spent for this project was Googling and searching for answers (CS in-a-nutshell, am I right?). This project challenge, however, was incredibly fun to undertake in my free time. I definitely learned a lot about working with APIs, HTTPs, markdown, and Python.  

###Note: 
*In order to get this going I needed to `python get-pip.py` which helped me with the requsts library and JSON. I included a link and file in my git repo to get it running in case you, the reader, don't know what I'm talking about. 
* I also uploaded these files in .py3 since Sublime was getting mad at me for not. If need be, one can switch them to .py by renaming the files. :) 

##Challenge 2 - Reverse a string: 
Once you’re registered, it’s time to get started on the challenges.

The first one is straightforward. You’re going to reverse a string.

That is, if the API says “cupcake,” you’re going to send back “ekacpuc.”

The getstring endpoint will return a string that your code should then reverse, as in the example above. Once that string is reversed, send it back to us.

##Challenge 3 - Needle in a haystack: 
Next, let’s check your skills for working with collections.

We’re going to send you a dictionary with two values and keys. The first value, needle, is a string. The second value, haystack, is an array of strings. You’re going to tell the API where the needle is in the array.

Locate the needle in the haystack array. You’re going to send back the position, or “index,” of the needle string. The API expects indexes to start counting at 0.

##Challenge 4 - Prefix: 
Great job -- but we’re not done with collections.

In this challenge, the API is going to give you another dictionary. The first value, prefix, is a string. The second value, array, is an array of strings. Your job is to return an array containing only the strings that do not start with that prefix.

Note: The strings in your array should be in the same order as in the original array.

##Challenge 5 - The Dating Game:
Great job so far. The last challenge is a little different. You’re going to work with dates and times.

The API will again give you a dictionary. The value for datestamp is a string, formatted as an ISO 8601 datestamp. The value for interval is a number of seconds.

##Refrences:
